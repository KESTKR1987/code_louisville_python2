# Code Louisville Data Science with Python Project

# The purpose of this project is to explore the ‘DSV Alvin’ submersible dataset and attempt to accurately predict the purpose of its dives using multiple features and the k-NN       machine learning algorithm.

# The dataset was taken from Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/akdagmelih/hov-alvin-dives-data

# Requirements
•	Python 3.7 and newer
•	Anaconda 4.9 and newer
# Installation
  1.	First download the project using git clone https://github.com/KESTKR1987/code_louisville_python2 Another option would be to download the zip file of the project.
  2.	Next, the installation of Jupyter Notebook or Lab. I had originally installed them using Anaconda which includes Jupyter Notebook, Lab, and a host of other programs.     https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual
  3.	Finally, as a general rule of thumb you want to create an environment in the conda navigator. Install these packages:
    a.	Pandas
    b.	Numpy
    c.	Matplotlib
    d.	Scikit-learn
# Jupyter Notebook
  In the main home page, click on the Jupyter Notebook or Lab tab. Go to the folder name and copy the notebook code. This will run your file.
